Who is our target audience?\n","\n","Let's answer these questions before we get started.\n","\n","Our team of consultants has been hired by the National Board of Crime Agencies* to present at their annual conference for their homicide analysis and prevention event. They have provided us with a robust dataset that includes homicide data on different types of agencies from all over the country from 1980 all the way up to 2014.\n","\n","They have presented us with the most pressing questions that these agencies would like to have answered. The board and all of the other conference attendees want to learn more about the trends/patterns in homicides over the years, so that they can improve their processes.\n","\n","*This is not a real organization."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8d333e0a","metadata":{"id":"8d333e0a"},"source":["## What questions are we aiming to answer?\n","\n","**#1 - Weapon Analysis :**  What are the most commonly used weapons in homicides and why might this be the case? What kind of weapons do certain age groups prefer? What kind of weapons do the different genders prefer?\n","\n","**#2 - Sex & Race Analysis :** What are the sex differences between homicide perpetrators and victims and the race breakdowns of victims? How have the race breakdowns changed over time?\n","\n","**#3 - Time Analysis :** Are there times when the number of homicides significantly rises or falls, and if so, what may have caused these changes? Does the frequency vary based on season?\n","\n","**#4 - Agency Effectiveness Analysis :** For the crimes that were solved, which agency types were the most effective? Which states’ agencies were the best at solving the crimes? Which were the worst?\n","\n","**#5 - Geographic & Predictive Analysis :** What are the regions or cities that have the most homicides? Why? What makes some areas more likely to have homicides, and can we use predictive analysis to find out which neighborhoods are most at risk?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"527ea139","metadata":{"id":"527ea139"},"source":["## Why does this matter?\n","\n","Homicide is a serious social problem with ramifications across society. It affects not only the\n","criminal justice system but also critically affects social and public health. The focus of our study is to\n","look deeply into homicide report data and use this to effectively make recommendations to the board and the conference's attendees.\n","\n","This analysis is important for the betterment of the nation because it will help us understand more about why so many lives are being lost due to homicides. We will be able to see which weapons are most commonly used, which seasons have the highest number of homicides and why, and so on and so forth. With this information, we could save the lives of people by equipping the different agencies with the tools and knowledge necessary to spot and prevent homicide crimes."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8ed063cc","metadata":{"id":"8ed063cc"},"source":["## How did we acquire this data?\n","\n","We start with importing data from Kaggle, where we carefully review a CSV file to make sure it is appropriate for our analysis environment. After that, we turn our attention to data cleansing and missing data management, which is a comprehensive review process that includes finding and addressing missing or unnecessary information as well as getting rid of duplicate records. We perform basic evaluations to comprehend data distributions, identify outliers, and display patterns that serve as a basis for more in-depth insights before fluidly transitioning into exploratory data analysis.we investigate victim age, sex, weapon type, offender sex, and victim race by utilizing the analytical features of libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Age distribution is shown, and gender, the use of weapons, and the demographics of the offenders are all subtly understood by filtering procedures. We utilize MATLAB's robust data visualization features to clarify the weapon and victim race distribution in the dataset."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c865dec3","metadata":{"id":"c865dec3"},"source":["## Choice of grading :\n","\n","We choose to be graded more heavily on **data analysis**.\n","\n","We believe that the work we did went above and beyond basic data analysis because of the nature of our dataset. Our dataset is incredibly large and requires a lot of visualization work to present to a completely new audience. Our visualizations summarize the dataset well and provide ample context for viewers. We also incorporated a predictive analysis portion, which we felt fit better with data analysis than with data processing. Finally, we believe that since we wanted to understand trends and patterns from our data in order to advise our client better, data analysis was the choice that made more sense."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9f0587ea","metadata":{"id":"9f0587ea"},"source":["# Let's get started!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f6fd9c80","metadata":{"id":"f6fd9c80"},"source":["## Importing Libraries :"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"fbcb7df0-df23-4eb7-8db9-28092972444b","metadata":{"id":"fbcb7df0-df23-4eb7-8db9-28092972444b","tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Importing the required libraries to select, filter, and transform data\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from numpy import nan as NA\n","\n","# Importing the required libraries to create visualizations\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import scipy\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n","from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","import plotly.express as px\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e71d420d","metadata":{"id":"e71d420d"},"source":["## Loading Dataset :"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"9c7ef5a4","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":377},"id":"9c7ef5a4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701881015089,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":340,"user":{"displayName":"matthew lin","userId":"11089072434328778964"}},"outputId":"58f3bb4f-00e3-4a93-cc02-6f9b82470fec"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Record ID Agency Code Agency Name       Agency Type       City   State  \\\n","0          1     AK00101   Anchorage  Municipal Police  Anchorage  Alaska   \n","1          2     AK00101   Anchorage  Municipal Police  Anchorage  Alaska   \n","2          3     AK00101   Anchorage  Municipal Police  Anchorage  Alaska   \n","3          4     AK00101   Anchorage  Municipal Police  Anchorage  Alaska   \n","4          5     AK00101   Anchorage  Municipal Police  Anchorage  Alaska   \n","\n","   Year    Month  Incident              Crime Type  ...

This greatly exceeds the 143,345 recorded number of female victims. The dataset may have limitations because of inadequate or non-disclosed gender information in some situations, as seen by the inclusion of a category labeled 'Unknown' containing 984 events. The notable gap between the number of victims by gender begs the question of what factors are at play and necessitates more research into the demographics of homicide episodes. Remarkably, there are notably 399,541 more occurrences with male perpetrators than with female perpetrators. A significant obstacle to fully comprehending the gender distribution is the high presence of the 'Unknown' category, which accounts for 190,365 events. This raises concerns regarding reporting procedures or the constraints of data collection. At 48,548 per year, female offenders are quite uncommon.\n","\n","### Now, let's create a visualization of this!\n","\n","We want to be able to view the breakdown between perpetrator sex and victim

visualization :\n","\n","There is a clear seasonal trend to the number of homicides; they peak in June and September and reach a low point in February. Interestingly, there is a decrease from August to November, indicating that there may be variations in violent occurrences in these months. As for seasons, an observation that we can make is that the highest number of homicides occur in the summer and the lowest number of homicides occur in peak winter.\n","\n","### Let's create an inference based on this visualization :\n","\n","The monthly variation in the number of homicides indicates a clear trend: there are more homicides in June through September and fewer homicides in February. There could be a number of reasons for the higher rates over the summer, including more people engaging in outdoor activities, more social interactions, and possible dispute escalation. All of these things could lead to an increase in violent occurrences. Furthermore, in some areas, warmer weather is frequently associated with greater crime rates. Conversely, the colder weather and fewer outdoor activities may have contributed to February's lower homicide rates by reducing the likelihood of confrontation or criminal activity. The cyclical nature of these oscillations is further highlighted by the observed drop from August to November, which implies that there may be a dip in the elements that lead to increased violence as summer gives way to fall. In addition, better weather might spur people to be outside more often and perpetrators have an easier time finding victims. Another reason could be that perpetrators have more free time during the summer, giving them ample time and freedom to commit these crimes.\n","\n","## Question #4 : Agency Effectiveness Analysis\n","\n","For the crimes that were solved, which agency types were the most effective?

This graphic depiction gives a clear picture of the cities with high homicide rates by highlighting the spatial distribution of violent episodes.Furthermore, the code looks at data at the state level to determine the weapon most frequently used in homicides in each state, providing a more comprehensive view of the various techniques utilized in deadly situations in various locations.\n","\n","### Let's make an inference based on our visualization :\n","\n","A number of intricate socioeconomic and demographic factors may contribute to increased homicide rates in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City. Big cities frequently struggle with problems like gang activity, poverty, and a concentration of underprivileged neighborhoods. Homicides and other crimes may occur at higher rates as a result of these circumstances. Social unrest and criminal activity may be exacerbated by economic inequality and restricted access to jobs and educational possibilities in some communities. Increased population density, difficulties with law enforcement, and easier access to firearms could all contribute to an increased risk of violent occurrences.
